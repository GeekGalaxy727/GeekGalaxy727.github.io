  			<p>Harry Potter. Often argued around the world as the best series ever to be written. 1,090,738 words, 3,363 pages, 199 chapters, 8 movies, 7 books, 4 directors, 2 Dumbledores, 1 extraordinary story. This series became world famous overnight and brought J.K. Rowling from broke single mother with a typewriter, to world famous billionaire. Behind the story  of the young boy with a scar, there is a story of an amazingly strong women who wrote the words down</p>

			<p>J.K. Rowling was a poor single mother, living off her friends charity. All she owned was a typewriter and a remarkable imagination. She took a train to London and was hit by inspiration and started writing about a young orphan who finds himself in a school for wizards, and learns the dark truth of his parents death. Little did she know that little idea lied a story that changed thousands of peoples lives. </p>
			<p>Before I say this please know I am a good person and I mean no harm. Harry Potter is not my favorite series. I know. Gasp, shun me if you must but it is my opinion. Although it was one a first read it, it is not anymore, and for good reson! Thalia Grace. That is my reason. Harry Potter isan amazing series and I love J.K. Rowling. She is wise and strong beyond her years. I just like Percy Jackson better. Sorry. </p>
